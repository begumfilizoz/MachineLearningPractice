# MachineLearningPractice
This repository includes some of my machine learning practice.
One of the models I worked on is the breast cancer model, I saw examples of this model during an internship and I also implemented the model.
This model gets a dataset of properties of certain cells that are labeled malignant or benign, and creates predictions based on these data.
